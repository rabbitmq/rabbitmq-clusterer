%% In general the comms process exists to perform blocking calls to
%% other nodes, without causing the main coordinator process to
%% block. Thus the communication between the coordinator and the comms
%% is always async even if the comms process goes on to do blocking
%% communication with other nodes. Thus we explain the existence of
%% multi_call.
%%
%% Once we have multi_call and we care about message arrival order, we
%% have to have multi_cast too so that messages arrive in the same
%% order they were sent.
%%
%% We also push the locking API in here. This is rather more complex
%% and is only used by the rejoin transitioner, where it is also
%% documented. But essentially the comms pid is the lock, and the lock
%% is taken by some other pid, which the lock monitors. Should the pid
%% that holds the lock die, the lock is released.
